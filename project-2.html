		<h2>What is Pak'n go</h2>
		<p>Pak’n go is designed to help people vote their opinion on how to dispose of items when moving out with other home members. </p>

		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>In the interface design assignment, we were required to design a functional app that can solve people’s problem effectively. Also, it should provide them a pleasant user experience. 

		Our goal is to create a visually pleasing and easily understandable App. We also hope to understand users’ problem and fulfil their needs through the interview and research.
		</p>

		<h2>Work progress</h2>
		<p>Firstly, we brainstormed few ideas how moving apps. After interviewing some people, the interviewees reflect that they often have different opinion of what to pack or discard when they are moving with other people. Since they share some properties in the house and one people cannot decide the dispose of the shared item. Then we narrow our topic down to focus on tackling the conflict when people have different opinion when packing items.</p>
