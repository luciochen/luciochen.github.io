        <h1>UI/UX design: Tool library showcase</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Tool library showcase is a platform for the Vancouver tool library to show its featured projects to educate members tool literacy. 
            It provides two ways to engage members to learn the project: instruction from workshops, and DIY instructions on how to replicate these projects. 
            <br><br>
            In this project, we implemented research tools to develop our understanding of the clients. 
            Finally, we came up with a design solution to enhance the workshop engagement and member's interest in tools.</p>

            <h2>Role</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User research</li>
                <li>UI/UX design</li>
                <li>Graphic design</li>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Course project: Interaction Design Methods (Spring 2020) <br><br>
                Group with Caleb, T., Dawood, S., and Fatima, I.
                <br><br>
                Tools: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop

        <h2>Our client & Objective</h2>
        <p>The Vancouver tool library strives to make Vancouver more sustainable through lending out tools. They also hold workshops like woodworking and leatherworking.

            Our group aimed to figure out the problem in the interaction inside this organization or how that they can be improved to enhance its sustainability.
        </p>
        


        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>During the research, I had a basic understanding of this organization by in-personal interviews with the manager and volunteers. After, I interviewed few members to get their demongraphic data and understand how
            they interact with the tool library. 
        </p>

        <h3>User journey map highlight</h3>

        <h2>Initial design focus</h2>
        <p>From the research, we found a large amount of Tool library members are experienced on neither using tools nor doing projects. It raised our concern about members' safety and tool maintenance. 
            Therefore, we chose our design focus as: Creating a smooth tool renting experience that ensures the safety of the customer and the condition of the tool for new/amateur users.  
        </p>

        <h2>Participatory Workshop</h2>
        <p>In this session, I took part in designing workshop activities like brainstorm, conversation starter, graffiti walls and so on. I practiced it to stimulate participants’ creativity to co-create with us  (Due to the influence of COVID-19, the workshop was held online)
        <br><br>
            
            Participants suggested a common need to educate amateur members with more project practice. Also, we learned that the tool safety from the initial focus should be avoided because it will become a liability.
        </p>

        <h2>Final design focus</h2>
        <p>After the workshop, we re-directed our design focus as:
            <span class="color-text">Enhance new and amateur member’s tool literacy through workshop engagement and projects. </span> 
            <br><br>The tool library's website is an existing platform that attracts members to go to the website to check tool inventory or other updates actively. Based on that, we finally chose the solution of a project showcase on the website.
            It leads members to check out the workshops that will potentially improve their tool literacy, while they still have the option to replicate the projects following
            the DIY instructions.

        <h3>Iteration of the projects' overview: changed layout</h3>
        <img src="images/section iteration.png" alt="">

        <h2>Interface design rationale</h2>

        <p> Since the original website lacks the visual identity of the organization, I decided to add images that can better show the story of the Vancouver tool library.
            Besides, I added a section to post member's project to increase the product engagement. Links to check tool inventory and workshop details integrate other
            features that exist on the original website.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Working closely with the Vancouver Tool Library, it helps me to understand how to research and design to tackle a real problem. 
            It allows me to practice many research methods to get a clear understanding of the goals and near problems from both stakeholders and users. 
            In the process, I always value the data gathered from the research. Finally, we delivered a feasible solution to help with this organization. 

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The product on the Vancouver tool library's main page is not very explicit, it causes a problem when it is hard to get people exposed to our product. It could have an in-store promotion to get more people to use this project showcase.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, if the participatory workshop goes offline, I will add more co-create activities to make it engaging. Also, we missed the opportunity for user testing.
            It will be valuable if we go to test out our product with Tool library's members in the store to get some feedback from the members.
