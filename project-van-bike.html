            <h2 class="no-margin-top">Overview</h2>
            <p>Van Bike is a route-planning app that helps novice bikers plan routes to unfamiliar places and ride safely in Vancouver. It allows users to select their desired route based on their experience level and road type preferences. The goal of this project is to create a comfortable biking experience so it encourages people in the city to bike more.

            </p>

            <h2 class="margin-top">Context</h2>
            <p>Before the redesign, this project was an Android development course project with teammate Keith. However, there were many technical constraints for two amateur developers to create the features we wanted. After that, I decided to redesign the app to create an integrated user experience without constraints in coding.

    <!-- start of the design process -->
    <div class="project-container margin-top">
        <h2>Project Request
        </h2>
        <p>Vancouver CityStudio’s request was to create an interactive map that helps residents to discover cycling routes in the city. To lower the carbon footprint in the transportation sector, the city tries to engage more residents in biking by creating a safe and convenient biking experience.


            <br><br>
            As the city says: “We want to prove it’s easier than you think to get to your friend's house by bike.” 
            
        </p>

        <h2>Research & Findings</h2>
        <p>
            To begin with, I discussed with CityStudio staff to understand their objectives and challenges. From this conversation, I decided to narrow the scope down to helping novice bikers since one big reason that stops citizens from biking is their lack of experience. 
            <br><br>
            Then, I interviewed 3 novice bikers. Since finding participants who match the demographics (both online and in-person) was difficult in this process, so I did secondary research by reading articles and blogs from HUB (a local cycling community) to reduce the bias caused by this small sample group.

        </p>

        <h2>Competitors Analysis</h2>
        <p>To understand why the city needs a dedicated cycling app, I analyzed 3 popular route planning apps for cyclists. As a result, these apps have limitations on choosing a route that reflects cyclists’ road preferences.

    <div class="project-container margin-top">
        <h2>Project Focus</h2>
        <p>Since safety and the ease of biking significantly impact people’s experience of biking. I decided to focus on creating a comfortable biking experience by avoiding dangerous factors on the road. Here is the focus of the project:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inform the users of the details like road types and potential dangers on the route.
            </li>
            <li>Allow the users to avoid specific roads based on their comfort level for each road type.
            </li>
        </ol>




        <h2>Sketches + Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Processes that focus on the features of informing users of the road types and general route information. Also, ideated the interaction from selecting a preferred route to map navigation. 
        </p>

        <img src="images/Van-Bike/Wireframes.jpg" alt="Wireframes">



        <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
        <p>Since the app caters to the novices, the visual design is created to deliver the feeling of “Approachable, Encouraging, and Trustworthy”.    
        </p>

            <h2 class="no-margin-top">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In the UI design iterations, I experimented with many options. For example, making the interface understandable and simple when integrating the Transit information into the route section. At the final stage, I practiced looking at the design from the user’s perspective, so I was able to trim off complex interactions to make the interface intuitive and elegant.
                
                <br><br>
                Overall, I believe the design answers the project requirement and provides a feasible solution for safe biking. If that’s possible, I will be gathering feedback from the CityStudio team and potential users in the future to refine this project.
