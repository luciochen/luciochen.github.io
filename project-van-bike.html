            <h2 class="no-margin-top">Overview</h2>
            <p>Van Bike is a route-planning app that helps novice bikers plan routes to unfamiliar places and ride safely in Vancouver. It allows users to select their desired route based on their experience level and road type preferences. The goal of this project is to create a comfortable biking experience so it encourages people in the city to bike more.

            </p>

            <h2 class="margin-top">Context</h2>
            <p>Originally, this project was an Android development project with teammate Keith L. in a course collaborating with Vancouver CityStudio. However, there were many technical constraints for two ametaur developers to create all the features we wanted. After the project, I redesigned the interface to serve our ambition.

    <div class="project-container margin-top">
        <h2>Project Request
        </h2>
        <p>Vancouver CityStudio’s request was to create an interactive map that helps residents to discover cycling routes in the city. To achieve the mission of lowering the Greenhouse Gases emission of the transportation sector, the city strives to create a safe and convenient biking experience for its residents. 

            <br><br>
            As the city says: “We want to prove it’s easier than you think to get to your friend's house with bike.” 
            
        </p>

        <h2>Research & Findings</h2>
        <p>
            To begin with, I listened to the CityStudio staff’s opinion and interviewed 2 novice bikers and 1 with no experience. 
            <br><br>
            Finding participants that match the demographic was very difficult during this project, so there was some bias in the results. To deal with that, I read HUB’s (local cycling community) blogs to gather more valid information on this topic.

        <h2>Competitors Analysis</h2>
        <p>To understand why the city needs a dedicated cycling app, I analyzed 3 popular route planning apps for cyclists. As a result, these apps have limitations on choosing a route that reflects cyclists’ road preferences.

        <h2>Project Focus</h2>
        <p>Since safety and the ease of biking significantly impact people’s experience of biking. I decided to focus on creating a comfortable biking experience by avoiding dangerous factors on the road. Here is the focus of the project:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inform the users of the details like road types and potential dangers on the route.
            </li>
            <li>Allow the users to avoid specific roads based on their comfort level for each road type.
            </li>
        </ol>




        <h2>Sketches + Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Processes that focus on the features of informing users the road types and general route information. Also, ideated the interaction from selecting a preferred route to map navigation. Here are some of the ideation process.

        <img src="images/Van-Bike/Wireframes.jpg" alt="Wireframes">



        <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
        <p>Since the app caters for the novices, the visual design is created to deliver the feeling of “Approachable, Encouraging, and Trustworthy”.

            <h2 class="no-margin-top">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In the UI design iterations, I experimented with many options. For example, making the interface understandable and simple when integrating the Transit information into the route section. At the final stage, I practiced looking at the design from the user’s perspective, so I was able to trim off complex interactions to make the interface intuitive and elegant.
                
                <br><br>
                Overall, I believe the design answers the project requirement and provides a feasible solution for safe biking. If that’s possible, I will be gathering feedback from the CityStudio team and potential users in the future to refine this project.
