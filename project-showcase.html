            <h2 class="no-margin-top">Overview</h2>
            <p>The Tool library showcase is a platform for the Vancouver tool library (VTL) to educate members about tool literacy with its featured handcraft projects.
                <br><br>
                In the process, I implemented user research to understand the client and its members, then designed the wireframes and interface mockup for a tool project showcase section on the tool library’s website. The goal was to enhance the workshop engagement and keep members interested in lending tools.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="project-container">
        <h2 class="no-margin-top-lg">The Client</h2>
        <p>The Vancouver tool library (VTL) is a non-profit organization that lends out physical tools instead of selling them to make the city more sustainable. It’s also a community for people who loves tools and DIY projects. The main users are the members who borrow tools & the participants of the tool workshops (like the leatherworking workshop).
           <br><br>
            My objective was to find out the pain points of the members and tried to deliver a better in-store/project experience for them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="no-margin-top-lg">User Research</h2>
        <p>
            To understand the goal of stakeholders, I talked with the manager to dive deeper into the business and its challenges. What I found is:
            <br> <br>
            1. This non-profit organization is striving for self-sustaining.<br>
            2. The board members hope to engage more people in tool borrowing and doing DIY projects.
            <br> <br>
            In the first two weeks, my teammate and I visited the store several times to observe and conduct in-person interviews with 4 store volunteers and some store members. These research data were recorded by note-taking or audio recordings. Then, I summarized the members’ experience in VTL in a user journey map.
        </p>
        <h3>User journey map</h3>
        <img src="images/user-journey.png" alt="user journey map">



        <h2 class="margin-top">Failure & Refocus</h2>
        <img src="images/concept poster.jpg" alt="concept posters">
        <span class="caption">Concept posters I designed to communicate to the class</span>
        <p>Then, our team brainstormed some solutions in a whiteboard session. We presented 3 concepts in the class: a safety guide brochure, video promotion, and in-store signage. However, the feedback we received pointed out that these solutions lack specificity, which indicates we didn’t focus on one problem from the research. These ideas ended up being “skimming the surface”.
            <br><br>
            Learning from the failure, I conducted more interviews and synthesize all research data with my teammates. The result surfaces a common problem: many members are <strong>less experienced in doing handcraft projects</strong>. Some of them have a project in mind but they are <strong>not equipped with sufficient knowledge to handle complex tools</strong>. Therefore, we decided to target new or amateur members.
        </p>


        <h2 class="no-margin-top-lg">Participatory Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            Then, our team held an online participatory workshop with 2 Tool Library volunteers. When designing the activities, I tried to engage participants to co-create with us using UX research activities like "5 Whys" and "Graffiti Wall", which allow the participants to speak out their opinion about possible design directions.
            <br><br>
            As a result, the participants taught us to avoid solutions about safety instruction since it can become a liability. Also, they indicate the interest in educating members on how to create tool projects since most members lack experience on projects.
        </p>
        <img src="images/participatory-workshop.jpg" alt="user journey map">


        <h2 class="no-margin-top-lg">Final Focus</h2>
        <p>After discussing the result, our team decided on the solution of <strong>an interactive project showcase that enhances new and amateur members’ tool literacy by allowing them to replicate DIY projects based on the instructions.</strong>
            <br><br>
            This solution is grounded in our previous research because the showcase instructs amateur members to replicate DIY projects to enhance their experience. At the same time, doing DIY projects will drive the tool borrowing and therefore increase store engagement.
            <br><br>
            Then, I drew a storyboard to demonstrate how the tool showcase will solve their problems in different touchpoints.

        <!-- <p>Since the original website lacks the visual representation of the organization, I decided to add images of craftmanship to better show the story of the Vancouver tool library. Besides, I added a section to post member's projects to increase engagement. Links to check tool inventory and workshop details integrate other features that exist on the original website.

        <p>The Showcase page shows possible projects to replicate. Also, there is a “Past Project” section that allows for checking others’ work for inspiration as well as showing off their project once it’s done.
            <br><br>
            Then, the user can choose the project they’re interested in and check out the tool workshop to learn how to handcraft the item with the professionals.

            <h2 class="margin-top-sm">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Working closely with Vancouver Tool Library, I practiced many user research methods in 
               this real business to understand the users and stakeholders' problems. I realized how in-depth user research can impact the quality of design output.
                As a result, the manager of the store appreciate the design and intended to implement this project showcase feature in the future website renovation.
            </p>

            <h2 class="margin-top">Reflection</h2>
            <p>However, we found that the showcase section on the website's home page is not very explicit and hard to 
                get noticed. Therefore, there is an opportunity to increase the exposure of our design solution by promoting our design and
                getting the users exposed to this showcase section during their interaction with the Tool Library.
