            <h2 class="no-margin-top">Overview</h2>
            <p>The Tool library showcase is a platform for the Vancouver tool library to educate members about tool literacy with its featured handcraft projects.
                <br><br>
                In the process, I implemented user research to understand the client and its members, then designed the wireframes and interface mockup for a tool project showcase section on the tool library’s website. The goal was to enhance the workshop engagement and keep members interested in lending tools.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="project-container">
        <h2 class="no-margin-top-lg">The Client</h2>
        <p>The Vancouver tool library is a non-profit organization that lends out physical tools to make the city more sustainable. It’s also a community for people who loves tools and DIY projects.
           <br><br>
            My objective was to find out the pain points of the members and tried to deliver a better in-store/project experience for the them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="no-margin-top-lg">User Research</h2>
        <p>
            During the research, I conducted in-person interviews with 4 volunteers and a few store members. In the process, I tried to understand their goal of joining Vancouver Tool Library, and their pain points when interacting with the library.
            <br><br>
            As a result, the research indicates a problem that many members are less experienced in doing handcraft projects. Some of them have a project in mind but are not equipped with sufficient knowledge to handle complex tools for their projects. 
        </p>
        <h3>User journey map</h3>

        <h2 class="no-margin-top-lg">Participatory Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            Then, our team decided to hold an online participatory workshop with 2 Tool Library volunteers. When designing the participatory workshop, I tried to engage participants in the activities to co-create with us. Therefore, I designed the warm-up questions and UX research activities like "5 Whys" and "Graffiti Wall" to allow the participants to speak out their opinion about possible design solutions.
            <br><br>
            As a result, the participants denies the idea of the tool safety brochure and taught me to avoid solutions about safety instruction since it can become a liability.
        </p>

        <h2 class="margin-top">Design Focus</h2>
        <p>After discussing the research result, our team decided to <span class="color-text"></span>enhance new and amateur member’s tool literacy using DIY projects and tool workshops.</span>

            <br><br>
            Based on members’ active engagement with the Tool library website, the final solution is to create a DIY project showcase, which provides the members a platform to replicate projects following given instructions and practice the use of tools.
         
        </p>
        <img src="images/whiteboard.JPG" alt="whiteboard section" class=" image-resize">

        <p class="margin-top">Then, I quickly mapped out a user interaction map to visualize the role of our design intervention in Vancouver Tool Library's user interaction. I also drew a storyboard to demonstrate the way users will interact with this design and how the tool showcase will solve their problems in different touchpoints.

        <h3>Storyboard</h3>
        <img src="images/storyboard.png" alt="storyboard">
    


        <h2 class="highlight-title">Final design</h2>
        <p>Since the original website lacks the visual representation of the organization, I decided to add images of craftmanship to better show the story of the Vancouver tool library. Besides, I added a section to post member's projects to increase engagement. Links to check tool inventory and workshop details integrate other features that exist on the original website.

            <h2 class="margin-top-sm">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Working closely with Vancouver Tool Library, I practiced many userful user research methods in 
               a real business and understand the problem from the users and stakeholders' perspective. 
                As a result, the manager of the store likes the design and was convienced that the design can be used as a 
                good reference to develop a website section.
            </p>

            <h2 class="margin-top">Reflection</h2>
            <p>However, we found that the showcase section on the website's home page is not very explicit and hard to 
                get noticed. Therefore, there is an opportunity to increase the exposure of our design solution by promoting our design and
                getting the users exposed to this showcase section during their interaction with the Tool Library.
