        <h1>UI/UX design: Tool library showcase</h1>
        <p>The Tool library showcase is a platform for the Vancouver tool library to show its featured projects to educate members tool literacy. 
            It provides two ways to engage members to learn the project: instruction from workshops and DIY instructions on how to replicate these projects. 
            <br><br>
            In this project, we rely on implementing research tools to develop our understanding of the clients. 
            Finally, we come up with a design solution to enhance the workshop engagement and member's interest on tools.</p>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Course project: Interaction Design Methods (2020) <br>
                Group with Caleb, T., Dawood, S., and Fatima, I.</p>

        <h2>Our client & Objective</h2>
        <p>The Vancouver tool library strives to make Vancouver more sustainable through lending out tools. They also hold workshops like woodworking and leatherworking.

                <!-- It hopes to engage more people in tool lending and project making to keep people interested in this organization. -->
                Our group aims to figure out the problem in the interaction inside this organization or how that they can improve to enhance its sustainability.
        </p>
        


        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>In the beginning of our research, I touch base this organization by in-personal interviews with the manager and volunteers, know how it runs and get basic demongraphic data of the members. 
            The findings are summarized in weekly poster to present in the class.
        </p>

        <h3>User journey map highlight</h3>

        <h2>Initial design focus</h2>
        <p>From the research, we found a large amount of Tool library members are not so experience on using tools and doing projects. It raised our concern of their safety and tool maintenance. 
            Therefore, we chose our design focus as: Creating a smooth tool renting experience that ensures the safety of the customer and the condition of the tool for new / amateur users.  
        </p>

        <h2>Participatory Workshop</h2>
        <p>In this session, I practiced workshop activities to stimulate participants’ creativity to co-create with us. (Due to the influence of COVID-19, the workshop was held online)
            I took part in designing the workshop workflow. It contains 5 activities, including brainstorm, conversation starter, drawings of idea solution and so on. <br><br>
            
            The takeaways from this workshop are suggestions of a way to educate amateur members to practice more project with tools. Also, we learned that the tool safety from initial focus should be avoid because it will become liability.
        </p>

        <h2>Final design focus</h2>
        <p>After the workshop, we re-direct our design focus as: <br>
            <b>Enhance new and amateur member’s tool literacy through workshop engagement and projects. </b>
            We finally chose the solution of a online showcase to better target amateur members in the tool library. The design focus will be represented in our Tool library showcase section in the website.
        </p>

        <h2>Design process</h2>

        <h3>Process of designing the project overview section</h3>
        <img src="images/section iteration.png" alt="">

        <h2>Interface design rationale</h2>

        <p> As the interface designer, I make decision based on: Since the original website lacks visual identity of the organization, I decide to add images that can better show the story of Vancouver tool library.
            Besides, I add a section to post member's project to increase the product engagement. Links to check tool inventory and workshop details integrate other
            features that exist in the original website.
        </p>

        <h2>Final design (Role: Interface design)</h2>

        <h3>DIY walkthrough</h3>
        <img src="images/DIY walkthrough.png" alt="">


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall, the user research in the design process gave me a better sense of how to study an organization and conduct user research. Besides, working with our client provides me the
            opportunity to learn how to understand their near problem and come up with a feasible design solution in the perspective of a designer.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>However, the product on the Vancouver tool library's main page is not very explicit, it causes problem when it is hard to get people exposed to our product. It needs more visual identity and promotions from the main web page or from social media.
