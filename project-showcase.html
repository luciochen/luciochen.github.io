                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>In an Interaction Design course project, we are required to collaborate with a local business find out their problem using user research and design a feasible solution to solve it.

                    Our final design is an online platform to enhance the store engagement by encouraging members to practice more DIY project.

                <h2 class="no-margin-top">CLIENT</h2>
                <p>The Vancouver tool library strives to make Vancouver more sustainable by lending out tools. It also holds handcrafting workshops to teach members how to DIY an artifact with these tools.
                    <br><br>
                    Our group aimed to find out the pain points in the interaction within this organization, and tried to deliver a better in-store/project experience for the members.

            <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
            <p>As part of our group's research, I conveyed in-person interviews with 4 volunteers and few members to understand their needs and pain points in this organization.
            </p>
            <p>After the research, our group found a large amount of amateur members are experienced on neither using tools nor doing projects, which raised our concern about members' safety and tool maintenance. 
                Therefore, we chose to focus on creating a smooth tool renting experience that ensures the safety of new/amateur users.

                <h2 class="no-margin-top">DESIGN FOCUS</h2>
                <p>After the workshop, we re-directed our design focus as:
                    <span class="color-text">Enhance new and amateur member’s tool literacy through workshop engagement and projects. </span> 
                    <br><br>
                    Based on members' active engagement with the Tool library website, we finally chose the solution of a project showcase on the website.
                    It leads members to check out the workshops that can offer the opportunity to learn to handcraft while getting familiar with the tools. Also, they still have the option to replicate the projects following
                    the DIY instructions.

        <h2>Role: Interface design</h2>

        <p> Since the original website lacks the visual identity of the organization, I decided to add images that can better show the story of the Vancouver tool library.
            Besides, I added a section to post member's project to increase the product engagement. Links to check tool inventory and workshop details integrate other
            features that exist on the original website.
        </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Working closely with Vancouver Tool Library, I practiced user research in studying a real business and understand the problem from the users’ perspective. The manager of the store likes the design and indicate the design can be used as a good reference to develop a new section on their website.
            </p>

            <h2 class="margin-top">Reflection</h2>
            <p>However, the design on the organization’s home page is not very explicit and hard to get noticed. Therefore, It would be better to run with an in-store promotion to attract store members.
                <br><br>
                During COVID-19. We missed the opportunity for the offline user testing, which could be valuable if we test out the design to know if it can engage more members in crafting or not.
